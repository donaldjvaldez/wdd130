        <p>Hi! I’m Donald Jared Valdez Savinon, but most people just call me Donald.
            I’m from San Juan de la Maguana, a small city in the Dominican Republic.
            I’m passionate about learning new things, helping others, and building a
            better future for my family and my community.</p>

        <p>I’m currently studying Software Development through BYU-Pathway, and I also
            have a background in Architecture with a focus on Urban Planning. One of my
            goals is to combine technology and design to create solutions that can make
            life easier and more organized for people.</p>
