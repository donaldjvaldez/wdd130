        <p>Hi! I'm Donald Jared Valdez Savinon, but most people just call me Donald.
            I'm from San Juan de la Maguana, a small city in the Dominican Republic.
            I'm passionate about learning new things, helping others, and building a
            better future for my family and my community.</p>

        <p>I'm currently studying Software Development through BYU-Pathway, and I also
            have a background in Architecture with a focus on Urban Planning. One of my
            goals is to combine technology and design to create solutions that can make
            life easier and more organized for people.</p>

        <img src="images/dominican-republic.jpg" alt="Dominican Republic's beach">
        <p>Known for its beautiful beaches, lush mountains, and lively culture, it is the most visited destination in
            the Caribbean.
            The country has a rich history, being the site of the first permanent European settlement in the Americas.
            Its people are
            known for their warmth, hospitality, and love of music and baseball. The economy is driven by tourism,
            agriculture, and
            services, and its capital city, Santo Domingo, is one of the oldest cities in the New World.</p>
